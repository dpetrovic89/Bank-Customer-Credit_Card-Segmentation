## What is Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

In business-to-business marketing, a company might segment customers according to a wide range of factors, including:

- Industry
- Number of employees
- Products previously purchased from the company
- Location

In business-to-consumer marketing, companies often segment customers according to demographics that include:

- Age
- Gender
- Marital status
- Location (urban, suburban, rural)
- Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.)

## Application to Customer Segmentation
#### Why Segment Customers?
Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development. Specifically, segmentation helps a company:

- Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests, instead).
- Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment. 
- Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities.
- Establish better customer relationships.
- Test pricing options.
- Focus on the most profitable customers.
- Improve customer service.
- Upsell and cross-sell other products and services.
